Pokémon Crystal Fate
====================

This ROM hack of Pokémon Crystal does not alter the core content of the game,
but alters many of the game mechanics in order to challenge the player.

For best results, no save scumming!

Whiting out
-----------

- All Pokémon in a player's party stay fainted after a white-out. This is
  effectively a game over unless the player has an egg or a Pokémon stored in
  Bill's PC.

Evolution and experience
------------------------

- Upon reaching every tenth level, a Pokémon evolves into another random
  species. Evolution cannot be canceled.
- Experience gains are adjusted by 10% per level difference between the
  fainting Pokémon and the Pokémon gaining experience. A KO on a Pokémon 10
  levels below yours yields no experience; a KO on a Pokémon 10 levels above
  yours yields double experience.
- All species are in the Fast experience group.

Healing
-------

- All full-party heals such as Pokémon Centers have been removed, except for
  Sacred Ash.
- Revives, Max Revives, and Revival Herbs have been removed.
- Ethers, Max Ethers, Elixers, and Max Elixers can be purchased in marts.
- HP-restoring, PP-restoring, status-curing, and battle items can be purchased
  at approximately one half of their regular prices.
- The Goldenrod City vending machines are out of service.

Other
-----

- Bill's PC cannot be used to manually deposit Pokémon. Pokémon that are caught
  when the player's party is full are deposited as usual.
- Eggs can be released using Bill's PC.
- Crits only occur under circumstances that raise critical hit chance (such as
  using a Dire Hit or a move with a high crit ratio).
- Repels have been removed, but wild encounters can be disabled via the options
  menu.
