Pokémon Crystal Fate
====================

This ROM hack of Pokémon Crystal does not alter the core content of the game,
but alters many of the game mechanics in order to challenge the player.

Evolution and experience
------------------------

- Upon reaching every tenth level, a Pokémon evolves into another random
  species. Evolution cannot be canceled.
- All species level up at the same rate, which is faster than usual at low
  levels and slower than usual at high levels.

Healing
-------

- All full-party heals such as Pokémon Centers have been removed, except for
  Sacred Ash.
- Revives, Max Revives, and Revival Herbs cannot be purchased and do not appear
  in the overworld.
- Ethers, Max Ethers, Elixers, and Max Elixers can be purchased in marts at
  approximately one tenth of their regular values.
- Other healing and status-curing items can be purchased at approximately one
  half of their regular prices.
- The Goldenrod City vending machines are out of service.

Other
-----

- Repels have been removed, but using an even-numbered text box frame prevents
  random encounters.
