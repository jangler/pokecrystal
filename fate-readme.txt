Pokémon Crystal Fate
====================

This ROM hack of Pokémon Crystal does not alter the core content of the game,
but alters many of the game mechanics in order to challenge the player.

For best results, no save scumming!

Evolution and experience
------------------------

- Upon reaching every tenth level, a Pokémon evolves into another random
  species. Evolution cannot be canceled.
- Experience gains are adjusted by 10% per level difference between the
  fainting Pokémon and the Pokémon gaining experience. A KO on a Pokémon 10
  levels below yours yields no experience; a KO on a Pokémon 10 levels above
  yours yields double experience.
- All species level up at the same rate.

Healing
-------

- All full-party heals such as Pokémon Centers have been removed, including the
  heal after whiting out. Sacred Ash is the only exception to this rule.
- Revives, Max Revives, and Revival Herbs have been removed.
- Ethers, Max Ethers, Elixers, and Max Elixers can be purchased in marts at
  approximately one tenth of their regular values.
- Healing, status-curing, and X items can be purchased at approximately one
  half of their regular prices.
- The Goldenrod City vending machines are out of service.

Other
-----

- Bill's PC can not be used to manually deposit Pokémon. Pokémon that are
  caught when the player's party is full are deposited as usual.
- Eggs can be released using Bill's PC.
- Crits only occur under circumstances that raise critical hit chance (such as
  using a Dire Hit or a move with a high crit ratio).
- Repels have been removed, but using an even-numbered text box frame prevents
  random encounters.
