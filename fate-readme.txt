Pokémon Crystal Fate
====================

This ROM hack of Pokémon Crystal does not alter the content of the game, but
alters many of the game mechanics in order to challenge the player.

- Upon reaching every tenth level, a Pokémon evolves into anothr random
  species. Evolution cannot be canceled.
- All full-party heals such as Pokémon Centers have been removed, except for
  Sacred Ash.
- Revives, Max Revives, and Revival Herbs cannot be purchased and do not appear
  in the overworld.
- Ethers, Max Ethers, Elixers, and Max Elixers can be purchased in marts at
  approximately one tenth of their regular values.
- Other healing and status-curing items can be purchased at half of their
  regular prices.
- The Goldenrod City vending machines are out of service.
- Repels have been removed, but using an even-numbered text box frame prevents
  random encounters.
