how to discourage trainer battles?

ideally the player should want to encounter as few trainers as possible.
battles should be dangerous events that could result in the depletion of a
player's resources and death of party members. fewer battles means a shorter,
more streamlined game where the player doesn't feel like they have to grind.

however, this principle directly contradicts the fundamental rpg-ness of
pok√©mon games. fighting makes you stronger, not weaker, and you win money from
it.

remove level influence entirely? or mostly? that gives you an incentive to
carry a full party, and makes restrictions on balls more pressing.
